# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Biometric-Image-Encryption-Optimization
This project focuses on optimizing the parameters of a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate encrypted biometric images. The aim is to create cancelable biometric templates with high accuracy by fine-tuning the GA's crossover and mutation rates.
